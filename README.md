Binary Search Algorithm — Python Implementation.  This project contains two simple and beginner-friendly implementations of the Binary Search Algorithm in Python.


🔍 Binary Search Algorithm in Python
This project contains two simple and efficient implementations of the Binary Search Algorithm using Recursive and Iterative approaches. It is designed for beginners who want to understand how binary search works and how to implement it in Python.


📘 Overview
Binary Search is a fast searching algorithm that works on sorted arrays.
It repeatedly divides the search interval in half and compares the target value with the middle element.


This project demonstrates:
✔ Recursive Binary Search
✔ Iterative Binary Search
✔ User input for list elements
✔ Automatic sorting before search
✔ Position output (1-indexed)
✔ Handling “element not found” cases


🚀 Features
🔹 Clean and easy-to-understand code
🔹 Demonstrates both recursion and loops
🔹 User-friendly input/output
🔹 Beginner-friendly logic flow
🔹 Efficient searching (O(log n))


🧩 How the Algorithm Works
Sort the input list
Select the middle element
Compare with the target
If equal → return position
If smaller → search left half
If larger → search right half
Repeat until found or interval becomes invalid


🧪 Example Input & Output
Input:
Enter length of list: 5
Enter elements: 3 8 2 9 6
Sorted list: [2, 3, 6, 8, 9]
Enter target element: 6


Output:
Element found at position: 3


📦 Requirements
Python 3.x
Any IDE or Jupyter/Colab
